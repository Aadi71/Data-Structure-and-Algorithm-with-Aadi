# Data-Structure-and-Algorithm-with-Aadi

This repository is for Data Structures & Algorithms questions that I'll be facing in acing this journey. I have made this repo to track myself and practice consistently. It may also be helpful to someone who might looking for problems.


Why I made this repo?
To track my progress and to maintain streak I have pressure to solve atleast a question daily.
DSA is not a one day or one month process, its around a year process if you're doing steadily and consistently.
